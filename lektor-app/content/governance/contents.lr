The purpose of the Pallets Project is to provide a home for the individual
projects so that users have a central place to go to to report bugs, provide
patches and get releases.  The idea of the Pallets Project is to be an
inclusive community around the projects that all live and breathe by the
same rules to make the projects less dependent on the original author without
compromising the design ideas behind them.
