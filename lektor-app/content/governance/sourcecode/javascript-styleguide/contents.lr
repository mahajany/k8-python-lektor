title: JavaScript Styleguide
---
body:

Pallets projects currently have very little JavaScript inside which is why
the guidelines are not fully set up so far.  There are only a handful of
rules to follow:

## Indentation

Two spaces

## Naming

* methods and functions: `camelCase`
* classes: `PascalCase`

## Strings

Try to use single quote strings for everything if you can.
