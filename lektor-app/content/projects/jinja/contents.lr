Jinja2 is a full-featured template engine for Python. It has full unicode
support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment,
widely used and BSD licensed.

## Jinja is Beautiful

```html+jinja
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
  <ul>
  {% for user in users %}
    <li><a href="{{ user.url }}">{{ user.username }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}
```

## And Powerful

Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by
Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language
that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it
adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for
applications where security is important.

It is internally based on Unicode and runs on a wide range of Python
versions from 2.5 to current versions including Python 3.

## Wide Range of Features

* Sandboxed execution mode. Every aspect of the template execution is monitored and explicitly whitelisted or blacklisted, whatever is preferred. This makes it possible to execute untrusted templates.
* powerful automatic HTML escaping system for cross site scripting prevention.
* Template inheritance makes it possible to use the same or a similar layout for all templates.
* High performance with just in time compilation to Python bytecode. Jinja2 will translate your template sources on first load into Python bytecode for best runtime performance.
* Optional ahead-of-time compilation
* Easy to debug with a debug system that integrates template compile and runtime errors into the standard Python traceback system.
* Configurable syntax. For instance you can reconfigure Jinja2 to better fit output formats such as LaTeX or JavaScript.
* Template designer helpers. Jinja2 ships with a wide range of useful little helpers that help solving common tasks in templates such as breaking up sequences of items into multiple columns and more.
