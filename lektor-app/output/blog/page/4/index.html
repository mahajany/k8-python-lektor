  </p>
  <p>After a very long, long waiting time Flask finally got a new release.  There
really was no good reason that there has not been a release in such a long time
but unfortunately once things are postponed for too long a certain release
anxiety kicks in.</p>
<p>In this case this was long tagged as 1.0 but we decided for renaming it to
0.11 and back out some of the more controversial changes.  In particular the
new command line interface for Flask was modified a bit to not depend on some
specific functionality in the supporting Click library.</p>
<p>Highlights of this release are the improved development experience which now
stalls the browser on reload instead of bringing up a "connection reset"
page and the new command line support.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2><p>This is also the first Flask release under the new pallets organization and
from now on we hope to bring you releases more frequently.  Ideally with the
next release we also update the website to find a new home for the showcase,
flask extension list as well as the snippet section to allow the community to
take care of those things themselves.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2><ul>
<li>Added support to serializing top-level arrays to <code>flask.jsonify</code>. This
introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/security/#json-security">json-security</a>
for details.</li>
<li>Added before_render_template signal.</li>
<li>Added <code>**kwargs</code> to <code>flask.Test.test_client</code> to support passing
additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
<code>flask.Flask.test_client_class</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST</code> config key that controls the
set-cookie behavior.  If set to <code>True</code> a permanent session will be
refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
<code>False</code> it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
expire if the browser window closes.</li>
<li>Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.</li>
<li>Added support for returning tuples in the form <code>(response, headers)</code>
from a view function.</li>
<li>Added <code>flask.Config.from_json</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>flask.Flask.config_class</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>flask.config.Config.get_namespace</code>.</li>
<li>Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
can be configured with the new <code>TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD</code> config key.</li>
<li>Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3's namespace loader.</li>
<li>Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3's namespace
packages.</li>
<li>Added the <code>flask</code> command and the <code>flask.cli</code> module to start the local
debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
<code>flask.run()</code> method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
different design and also replaces <code>Flask-Script</code>.</li>
<li>Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
exceptions (in <code>werkzeug.exceptions</code>).  This makes it possible
for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
a custom error handler if desired.</li>
<li>Added <code>flask.Config.from_mapping</code>.</li>
<li>Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
<code>LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY</code> configuration key.</li>
<li>Removed deprecated module functionality.</li>
<li>Added the <code>EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING</code> config flag which when enabled will
instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.</li>
<li>Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
loading.</li>
<li>Ported test suite to py.test.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>request.json</code> in favour of <code>request.get_json()</code>.</li>
<li>Add "pretty" and "compressed" separators definitions in jsonify() method.
Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
unnecessary white space included by default after separators.</li>
<li>JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don't
deal well when this newline is missing. See
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262">https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262</a> -- this came up originally as a
part of <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168">https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168</a></li>
<li>The automatically provided <code>OPTIONS</code> method is now correctly disabled if
the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
<code>options</code> (issue <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1288"><code>#1288</code></a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/api/#flask.json.jsonify"><code>flask.json.jsonify</code></a> now supports the <code>datetime.date</code> type (pull request
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1326"><code>#1326</code></a>).</li>
<li>Don't leak exception info of already caught exceptions to context teardown
handlers (pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1393"><code>#1393</code></a>).</li>
<li>Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1422"><code>#1422</code></a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/api/#flask.g"><code>flask.g</code></a> now has <code>pop()</code> and <code>setdefault</code> methods.</li>
<li>Turn on autoescape for <code>flask.templating.render_template_string</code> by default
(pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1515"><code>#1515</code></a>).</li>
<li><code>flask.ext</code> is now deprecated (pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1484"><code>#1484</code></a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/api/#flask.send_from_directory"><code>send_from_directory</code></a> now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
the server OS (pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1763"><code>#1763</code></a>).</li>
<li>Added the <code>JSONIFY_MIMETYPE</code> configuration variable (pull request <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1728"><code>#1728</code></a>).</li>
<li>Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
contexts lingering around.</li>

  </p>
  <p>Today we pushed out a <a href="/p/werkzeug/">Werkzeug</a> bugfix release which contains
a security relevant fix.  It has come to our attention (reported by <a href="https://github.com/JordanMilne/">Jordan Milne</a>)
that the PIN brute-force protection in the Werkzeug debugger could be bypassed
by attacking the cookie rather than the PIN.  While this is generally not easily
fixable we improved the situation by mixing in higher quality secret data into the
cookie name and made it more complex.  We now include a UUID of the machine
the code is running on.</p>
<p>This should make it significantly more complex to bypass the PIN check.  That said
we want to reiterate that the PIN protection for the debugger is <em>not a suitable
protection to run the debugger in production</em>.  It's a basic security feature to make
it less likely to use an accidentally enabled debugger.  Please ensure that you never
enable the debugger in production environments regardless of this feature.</p>

  </p>
  <p>On the first of April 2010, I released a joke microframework called denied
which made fun of the fact that all microframeworks at the time decided to
forgo with dependencies and bundle up everything they need in a single Python
file.  What I did was embed all of Jinja2 and Werkzeug in a base64 encoded
zip file within the framework's only Python file.  The response to it was
interesting in a few ways because on the one hand quite a few people did not
really understand that it was an April fools joke to begin with and on the
other, there was a discussion where there were no microframeworks that actually
did use dependencies and encouraged it.</p>
<p>One month later there was a new project by the name of "Flask" which actually
gave this concept a real shot.  It launched with the tagline "a microframework
for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions" and six years later
it's the most starred Python framework on GitHub.</p>
<p>What's interesting about Flask is that its success just happened.  There are
no conferences about it, no society or foundation and still today much of it
heavily depends on me directly.  I'm not even sure why it became this
successful but I attribute a lot of it to the fact that it's easy to get
started and the full footprint of the framework is small enough that it becomes
easy enough to understand.</p>
<p>So what's changing now?  Today we launch the Pallets Projects.  What is it?
Primarily it's a GitHub organization which will be the home of Flask and all
the associated projects.  It will be a new home for those libraries and the
first step to give the community more impact on the development of Flask and
all libraries.  In addition there will be a new release of Flask very soon
after a thorough check that we do not break anything.</p>
<p>The people behind the Pallets Projects are <a href="/people/mitsuhiko/">me</a>,
<a href="/people/untitaker">Markus Unterwaditzer</a>, <a href="/people/davidism/">David Lord</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ThiefMaster">Adrian Mönnich</a> with the organization
being open for newcomers to help and drive the projects forward.</p>
<p>We will spend the next few weeks adding as much organizational information on
the project's website to ensure that what often currently only exists in my
head is brought down to text.</p>
<p>I'm amazed how many people use and love Flask and my libraries and I hope that
this organization will be a good step towards making this scale past me.  It's
humbling how big all of this became.</p>
