  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Werkzeug 0.15.0. This represents
over a year of work from the community and maintainers, and as such
there is an unusually long list of changes. Some of the notable ones
are listed below, but there are many more throughout the framework.
<a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/changes/">Read the full changelog</a>
to understand what changes may affect your code when upgrading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Building URLs is ~7x faster.</li>
<li>Redirects now use HTTP code 308 by default. This preserves the method
and form data.</li>
<li><code>int</code> and <code>float</code> URL converters can handle negative numbers.</li>
<li>The debugger saw a number of improvements. Python 3's chained
exceptions are correctly displayed and logged. Frames of user code
are highlighted to make it easier to read tracebacks.</li>
<li>The reloader is much better at detecting how to re-run itself. It
handles <code>python -m</code> as well as non-Python executable scripts.</li>
<li>The test client takes a <code>json</code> parameter, and the response class has
a <code>get_json</code> method. This makes testing JSON APIs much more
straightforward.</li>
<li>URLs with Unicode or percent-escapes are handled better. Quoting when
converting between URIs and IRIs is more consistent, and the unquoted
URL is logged by the dev server rather than showing percent escapes.</li>
<li>Deprecation warnings have been added throughout the code in
preparation for version 1.0.</li>
<li>Werkzeug now uses <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit</a>, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports">reorder-python-imports</a>,
and <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> to provide consistent code formatting. The code also
moved to a <code>src</code> directory layout.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="werkzeug.contrib-has-been-deprecated"><code>werkzeug.contrib</code> has been deprecated</h2><p>The code under the <code>werkzeug.contrib</code> package has been deprecated. In
version 1.0, code will either be moved into <code>werkzeug</code> core, or will be
removed completely. Contrib started as a place to put code that wasn't
clear where it belonged. In the 12 years since Werkzeug started, the
packaging ecosystem and Werkzeug's codebase have evolved. The contrib
code has not been widely maintained, often having better implementations
elsewhere or no longer being required.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ProxyFix</code>, <code>LintMiddleware</code>, and <code>ProfilerMiddleware</code> have moved into
<code>werkzeug.middleware</code>.</li>
<li><code>securecookie</code> and <code>sessions</code> have been extracted to the
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/secure-cookie">pallets/secure-cookie</a>
repository.</li>
<li><code>cache</code> has been extracted to the
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/cachelib">pallets/cachelib</a> repository.</li>
<li>Everything else is deprecated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deprecation-warnings">Deprecation Warnings</h2><p>Besides contrib, many other parts of Werkzeug have been marked, either
explicitly or implicitly, as deprecated, for many years. This release
ensures that every occurrence issues a clear deprecation warning that
mentions when the code will be removed. Currently, everything marked
deprecated is slated to be removed in version 1.0.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unused compatibility imports for code that was moved to another module
within Werkzeug. This code is still available, but should be imported
from the correct location.</li>
<li>Middleware in <code>werkzeug.wsgi</code> has moved to <code>werkzeug.middleware</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>werkzeug.wrappers</code> module was converted to a package of more
specific modules. Imports for classes that were publicly documented in
the previous version will work without change.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install-or-upgrade">Install or Upgrade</h2><p>Install from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U Werkzeug
</code></pre>

  <p>One of my goals as a Pallets maintainer is to build the community around our projects. The Pallets projects (Flask, Jinja, Click, etc.) are downloaded millions of times each month, but it's hard to get a clear picture of what our users do and want with downloads stats only. We'd like to learn about you and your projects. Knowing more about our community will help us decide what to focus on to grow the Pallets projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.</li>
<li>Using newer CPython APIs gave the C extension a 1.5x speedup on Python 3. Python 2 will still get the same speed as before, but you should consider upgrading if possible.</li>
<li>The <code>escape</code> function uses the <code>__html__</code> method on an object if it's available. It will now ensure that result is wrapped in the <code>Markup</code> class, for consistency with other behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="platform-wheels">Platform Wheels</h2><p>Installing from PyPI with pip will now install a precompiled wheel if available. Wheels have been compiled for supported CPython versions on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<p>MarkupSafe comes with a C extension that adds a significant speedup to escaping. However, if a compiler or headers aren't available, the install will fall back to a native Python implementation. Previously, the user would see no indication that they didn't get the speedups, or would see confusing error messages even though the install succeeded. Now, many more users will be able to take advantage of the speedups provided by MarkupSafe without extra configuration.</p>

  </p>
  <p>itsdangerous 1.1.0 has been released to fix compatibility issues that were affecting projects while upgrading. Due to these issues, we had to make a quick decision and pull itsdangerous 1.0.0 from PyPI earlier today to prevent more projects from being affected. We appologize for the difficulty this caused, and the changes in this release should address compatibilty going forward.</p>
<p>1.0.0 changed the default digest algorithm from SHA-1 to SHA-512. SHA-1 as used by itsdangerous was never suceptible to the collision issue published last year, but the change was made for peace of mind. However, this change invalidated existing signatures that were in use.</p>
<p>To address this, 1.1.0 reverts the default digest to SHA-1. It also adds a fallback mechanism to try other algorithms when unsigning. This gives projects a safe way to upgrade signing parameters in the future, while still supporting existing signatures during the upgrade period. A default fallback for SHA-512 was added to support projects that were already affected by the 1.0.0 version. 1.1.0 is therefore compatible with both 0.24 and 1.0.0, so upgrading should be safe in either case.</p>
<p>Additionally, we reverted a change to the project name in setup.py. 1.0.0 changed the capitalization from "itsdangerous" to "ItsDangerous", but this caused issues with some systems. The name will remain as "itsdangerous".</p>
<p>We appologize again for the issues and thank everyone in the community who contributed to the discussion.</p>

  <p>It's Dangerous 1.0.0 has been released. See the <a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/changes/#version-1-0-0">changelog</a> for a list of changes since the last release on 2014-03-28.</p>
<p>It's Dangerous provides secure message signing and serialization. Without the secret key used to sign a message, the content cannot be changed without invalidating the signature. This allows, for example, Flask to store information in a session cookie that is transmitted over public networks, and be sure that the data has not been tampered with when loading a subsequent request.</p>
<h2 id="install-or-upgrade">Install or Upgrade</h2><p>Install from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ItsDangerous">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U ItsDangerous
</code></pre>
<h2 id="imports-will-change">Imports will change</h2><p>Previously, It's Dangerous was a single Python module with about 1000 lines of code. The project has been reorganized as a package with submodules, which will make the code easier to navigate going forward.</p>
<p>However, this means that <em>everything</em> that It's Dangerous imported or defined used to be importable from <code>itsdangerous</code>. With the reorganization, only the public API is importable from <code>itsdangerous</code>. To ease transition, "public" was defined as any name that was previously documented in the API section. These compatibility imports will be deprecated and removed in future releases. If you were importing undocumented names, you'll need to import them from the correct submodule now.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-docs">Read the Docs</h2><p>It's Dangerous has moved its docs to Read the Docs. The new URL for the docs is <a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/">https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The docs were previously hosted on PyPI's docs site (<code>pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous</code>), but this site has been deprecated and it is no longer possible to upload new docs there. Unfortunately, due to the deprecation, there is no way to add a redirect to the new docs. As of this release, any URLs pointing to the old site will break.</p>

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Click 7.0. Thank you to everyone who contributed online and in person at the PyCon US 2018 sprint! With the help of the community as well as some new maintainers, we've managed to resolve hundreds of long standing issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>Due to the length of time since the last release, there are a significant number of new features and fixes. <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/master/changelog/#version-7-0">Check out the changelog</a> for a list of all code changes and links to the relevant issues. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell autocompletion has improved in a number of areas.<ul>
<li>Native ZSH completion was added, and supports its enhanced parameter documentation.</li>
<li>The choice type can be completed.</li>
<li>Completion correctly handles chained commands, spaces, defaults, and partial completions.</li>
<li>Parameters can provide a callback to customize completion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Windows <code>click.echo</code> can now output more than 16k characters in one call. On Windows 7, a 64k limit on binary stream output is also worked around.</li>
<li><code>click.getchar</code> returns Unicode on Windows.</li>
<li>When piping input and output, more cases of closed pipes are detected and handled instead of raising errors.</li>
<li>The <code>CliRunner</code> used for testing separates stdout and stderr.</li>
<li>New <code>DateTime</code> and <code>FloatRange</code> parameter types.</li>
<li>Flags to mark a parameter as hidden or deprecated.</li>
<li>Numerous improvements and fixes to i/o, help, parameters, and testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="read-the-docs">Read the Docs</h2><p>Click is the first Pallets project to move its docs to Read the Docs. Our projects currently use a custom builder and hosting, but this became too difficult with limited maintainer time. Thank you to everyone at RTD who helped with the transition!</p>
<p>The new URL for the docs is <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">https://click.palletsprojects.com/</a>. The old <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/">http://click.pocoo.org/</a> domain will redirect to the new one while we continue to migrate, but will eventually go away. Please use the new URL going forward.</p>
<p>Click's docs use a custom Sphinx theme and extensions. As part of the move, these were extracted to a separate Python package. Install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pallets-Sphinx-Themes">Pallets-Sphinx-Themes</a> to use Click's theme when writing extensions for a more cohesive look.</p>

  <p>In May I attended PyCon US 2018 in Cleveland, Ohio. It's a great opportunity to meet people interested in the Pallets projects and Python web applications. It can be a little intimidating, but also a lot of fun. The biggest difficulty is that there are <em>too many</em> things to do, and I always wish everyone could have a few more days together.</p>
<p>During the main conference, while talks are happening, anyone can organize "open spaces," impromptu meetings for any topic. I organized a Pallets open space, and we had a huge turnout. I was kind of unprepared for the size, so we started with people asking me questions, and then split up into tables for new users, Flask, Click, and Jinja.</p>

<p>For up to four days after the talks, developers get together for sprints, working together to contribute to Python open source projects. Experienced developers help new ones learn how to contribute, and everyone gets to learn about new projects and meet the developers behind them.</p>

<p>At the open space, I had mentioned that no one had really been maintaining Click for the past year. It turns out a <em>lot</em> of people use Click. They came motivated from the open space to contribute during the sprint. Some were new to contributing, but they all had one thing in common: they knew how Click was being used more than I did! So I took a chance and gave them all write permissions to the repository. Click started at ~250 open issues and 68 pull requests. After 2 days, it was at 140 issues and 22 pull requests. Wow! With that success, I'm officially welcoming all these new maintainers to the Pallets Click team. While Click stole the show, we had great contributions to Werkzeug, Flask, and Jinja as well.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved, a great way is to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/">watch our repositories on GitHub</a>. You'll get notifications for each issue, so you can see what's happening and start contributing. You can help by triaging issues, improving tests and documentation, and fixing bugs. If your company uses a Pallets project like Flask, Click, or Jinja, consider pointing them to our <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/donate">PSF donation page</a>. Donations will help get maintainers to more events so we can do more sprints like this one. Thank you to everyone at PyCon and in the community for making Pallets a success!</p>
