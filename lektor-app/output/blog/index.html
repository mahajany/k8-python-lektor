  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Werkzeug 1.0. Werkzeug is the
low-level WSGI and HTTP toolkit that powers Flask. It's been almost 13
years since the first commit, and this milestone for the project brings
many fixes and changes. <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/changes/#version-1-0-0">Read the full changelog</a>
to understand what may affect your code when upgrading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 3.4. This will be the last version to
support Python 2.7 and 3.5.</li>
<li>Remove most top-level attributes provided by the <code>werkzeug</code> module
in favor of direct imports. If you haven't already, use
<a href="/blog/werkzeug-0-16-0-released">version 0.16</a> first to see
deprecation warnings while upgrading.</li>
<li>Cookies support the <code>samesite='None'</code> option. Cookies are parsed
as a <code>MultiDict</code> instead of overwriting repeated keys.</li>
<li>The development server supports 2-way TLS, making it easier to
develop applications that inspect client certificates.</li>
<li>When building URLs with host matching, the current host is accounted
for when deciding what rule to build.</li>
<li>When defining and matching URL rules, consecutive slashes are merged
by default to match the behavior of common HTTP servers.</li>
<li>The <code>Accept</code> header preserves order for tags with equal quality and
considers options on each value. The  <code>Accept-Language</code> header can
match the primary tag if the specific value is not present.</li>
<li>Added CORS header attributes to <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>.</li>
<li>A URL rule can be marked as a <code>websocket</code>, in which case it will
only match for <code>wss://</code> requests. This allows async web frameworks
to use Werkzeug for routing.</li>

  <p>Upstream support for Python 2.7 is ending on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/">January 1, 2020</a>.
Pallets is joining the <a href="https://python3statement.org/">community of open source projects</a>
ending support for Python 2 at that time. Our statement and support plan
are based on <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/5.3.2/py27-py34-deprecation.html">PyTest's announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We will be dropping support for Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.5 and
below, as their support windows have ended or will end around the same
time. Future releases of each Pallets project will only support Python
versions still supported upstream, which can be found in the
<a href="https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches">Python Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The last version branch of each core project to support Python 2.7
and Python 3.5 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flask 1.1.x</li>
<li>Werkzeug 1.0.x</li>
<li>Click 7.x</li>
<li>Jinja 2.11.x</li>
<li>ItsDangerous 1.1.x</li>
<li>MarkupSafe 1.1.x</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project will receive a major version bump to indicate support
for only 3.6+:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flask 2.0</li>
<li>Werkzeug 2.0</li>
<li>Click 8.0</li>
<li>Jinja 3.0</li>
<li>ItsDangerous 2.0</li>
<li>MarkupSafe 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the <code>python_requires</code> package metadata, Python 2.7 and
3.5 users with a modern pip version will install the last supported
version automatically even if later versions are available.</p>
<p>The team will no longer backport patches for unsupported versions, but
the branches will continue to exist. The team will be happy to
accept patches contributed by the community for any severe security and
usability issues until mid-2020.</p>
<p>We made this decision based on multiple factors. Foremost is ease of
community contribution and maintainer availability. As time goes on,
fewer contributors have used or are familiar with the differences
between Python 2 and 3. Contributors and maintainers must keep track of
an ever growing list of obscure compatibility issues and workarounds,
and cannot use many modern features.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, we've talked to many developers and teams at
conferences and meetups and heard overwhelming support for the move to
Python 3. This is backed up by data collected from our community in a
survey we ran during January 2019, with 92% of respondents already using
or actively upgrading to Python 3. The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#python-3-adoption">PSF developer survey</a> and
PyPI statistics report similar majorities and show adoption continuing
to increase.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in the community for your support, and to everyone
who has made this transition a reality. We look forward to continuing
to develop the Pallets projects with you!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Werkzeug 0.16.0 has been released. The only change is that most of the
top-level attributes in the <code>werkzeug</code> module are now deprecated, and
will be removed in 1.0.0.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <code>import werkzeug; werkzeug.url_quote</code>, do
<code>from werkzeug.urls import url_quote</code>. If you are using these imports in
your project, a deprecation warning will show the correct import to use.
<code>werkzeug.exceptions</code> and <code>werkzeug.routing</code> should also be imported
instead of accessed, but for technical reasons can’t show a warning.</p>
<p>These imports were supported by patching the <code>werkzeug</code> module to
support lazy imports, but the implementation added complexity, and there
was no clear design reason why some things were available and some
weren't. It also masked some circular dependency issues. IDEs like
PyCharm didn't know those lazy imports existed and were already
correctly using the full imports.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Werkzeug 0.15.5 has been released, containing bug and security fixes.
The <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/changes/#version-0-15-5">changelog</a> lists the changes in detail, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> safely handles drive names in paths on Windows.</li>
<li>The reloader no longer causes an <code>Exec format error</code> in many common
situations.</li>
<li>The reloader works around an issue when using the pydev debugger.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-fix-for-shareddatamiddleware-on-windows">Security fix for <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on Windows</h2><p>Prior to 0.15.5, it was possible for a third party to potentially access
arbitrary files when the application used <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on
Windows. This issue was assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14322">CVE-2019-14322</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the way Python's <code>os.path.join()</code> function works on Windows, a
path segment with a drive name will change the drive of the final path.
This was <a href="/blog/flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release/">previously addressed</a> in the <code>safe_join()</code> function in
<a href="/blog/flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release/">Werkzeug 0.12.2</a>, but <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> used a separate
implementation and so was not secured by the previous fix.</p>
<p><code>SharedDataMiddlware</code> now uses <code>safe_join()</code> when fetching requested
files. Projects using <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on Windows should update
as soon as possible to receive the fix.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="mailto:byemre.ovunc@gmail.com">Emre Övünç</a> and <a href="mailto:security@odoo.com">Olivier Dony</a> for responsibly
reporting the issue. If you think you have discovered a security issue

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release <a href="/p/flask/">Flask</a> 1.1. The
latest version is 1.1.1. Version 1.0.4 was also released.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 3.4.</li>
<li>Bump minimum Werkzeug version to 0.15.</li>
<li>The way error handlers for <code>InternalServerError</code> and <code>500</code> work has
been made more consistent. See below for more information.</li>
<li><code>app.logger</code> once again takes the same name as <code>app.name</code>, reverting
1.0.x's behavior of hard-coding <code>"flask.app"</code>. See below for more
information.</li>
<li><code>jsonify</code> supports Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"><code>dataclasses</code></a>.</li>
<li>Returning a <code>dict</code> from a view function will produce a JSON
response. This makes it even easier to get started building an API.</li>
<li>A clearer error message is shown when a view returns an unsupported
type.</li>
<li>URL routing is performed after the request context is pushed. This
allows custom URL converters to access <code>current_app</code> and <code>request</code>.
This makes it possible to implement converters such as one that
queries the database for a model based on the ID in the URL.</li>
<li>CLI commands can be registered with blueprints using the new
<code>bp.cli</code> attribute. These will be available as nested commands, for
example <code>flask user create</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/changelog/"><strong>Read the changelog</strong></a>
for the full list of changes. Be sure to check the notes for the 1.0.x
versions as well.</p>
<h2 id="change-to-error-handling">Change to Error Handling</h2><p>Prior to 1.0, unhandled errors caused a generic <code>InternalServerError</code> to
be returned, but only the handler for <code>500</code> was looked up for that, and
the original error was passed to it. 1.0 made <code>500</code> an alias for
<code>InternalServerError</code>, but these inconsistencies caused confusion over
what errors were passed to what handlers.</p>
<p>As of 1.1, an error handler registered for <code>InternalServerError</code> or
<code>500</code> means the same thing in all cases. It will always be passed an
instance of <code>InternalServerError</code>, even if it was caused by an unhandled
error of another type. The original error is available as
<code>e.original_exception</code>.</p>
<p>If your project uses a <code>500</code> error handler that expects any exception to
be passed to it, it should use <code>e.original_exception</code> instead of <code>e</code>.</p>
<h2 id="change-to-logging">Change to Logging</h2><p>In 1.0, Flask's logging setup was greatly simplified. Part of that was
hard-coding the name <code>"flask.app"</code> for the logger. However, that made it
less clear whether Flask or the app was doing the logging, and made it
impossible to distinguish between multiple apps in logs.</p>
<p>As of 1.1, <code>app.logger</code> again takes the same name as <code>app.name</code>. Flask
will warn you if it detects logging configuration for <code>"flask"</code> or
<code>"flask.app"</code> so you can rename that configuration appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, if your project is named <code>example.py</code> and you initialize
your Flask app as <code>Flask(__name__)</code>, then the logger will be named
<code>"example"</code>.</p>

<li>The debugger pin is unique per Docker container.</li>
<li>Fix issues with the arguments to the <code>Unauthorized</code> HTTP exception.</li>
<li>Fix <code>ProfilerMiddleware</code> filenames, and get <code>LintMiddleware</code> working
on Python 3.</li>
<li>Bytes passed to URLs will be correctly decoded rather than having a
<code>b</code> prefix.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugger-pin-security">Debugger Pin Security</h2><p>A minor security issue was addressed in this release. The debugger
generates a unique pin per host to prevent unauthorized code execution.
However, in Docker this pin would be identical across all containers.
This release ensures each container uses a unique pin.</p>

  <p>Flask-SQLAlchemy 2.4.0. has been released. The
<a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/changelog/#version-2-4-0">changelog</a>
lists the changes in detail, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make SQLAlchemy engine configuration more flexible</li>
<li>Address SQLAlchemy 1.3 deprecations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deprecation-warnings">Deprecation Warnings</h2><p>New deprecation warnings have been added for configuration and <code>__init__</code> params that are no longer
needed due to the engine configuration now being more customizable.  Those options will be removed
in release 3.0.</p>

  <p>Jinja 2.10.1 has been released and includes a security-related fix. If
you are using the Jinja <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/sandbox/">sandboxed environment</a> you are encouraged to
upgrade.</p>
<p>MITRE has assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10906">CVE-2019-10906</a> to this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://brianwel.ch">Brian Welch</a> for responsibly reporting the issue, and to
<a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a> for writing the fix.</p>
<p>The sandbox is used to restrict what code can be evaluated when
rendering untrusted, user-provided templates. Due to the way string
formatting works in Python, the <code>str.format_map</code> method could be used to
escape the sandbox.</p>
<p>This issue was previously addressed for the <code>str.format</code> method in
<a href="/blog/jinja-281-released/">Jinja 2.8.1</a>, which discusses the issue in detail. However, the
less-common <code>str.format_map</code> method was overlooked. This release applies
the same sandboxing to both methods.</p>
<p>If you cannot upgrade Jinja, you can override the <code>is_safe_attribute</code>
method on the sandbox and explicitly disallow the <code>format_map</code>
method on string objects.</p>
